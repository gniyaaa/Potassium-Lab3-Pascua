                <p>Roblox is an online platform where users can create, share, and play games made by others. It features a diverse range of user-generated experiences, from adventure to simulation. Players use Roblox Studio to build their own games, which are then shared with the community. The platform is popular for its social interactions and creative freedom.</p>
